## Table
You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -.
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row ---. and You can use formatting such as links, inline code blocks, and text styling within your table:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all new or modified files |
| *git diff* | Show file differences that **haven't** been staged |

You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons : to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row. To include a pipe | as content within your cell, use a \ before the pipe:

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff \|   |
